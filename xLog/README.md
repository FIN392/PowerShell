you have two flavors to choose from: _Straight_ or _MultiFormat_ (Vanilla or Tutti Frutti).

The _Straight_ output is just a plain text file. _MultiFormat_ give you the possibility of formats like HTML, CSV, XML or JSON.

_Straight_ is my choice in the 99% of cases, only if you need to integrate your log in an existing log management tool, _MultiFormat_ can help.
